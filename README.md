**EMAIL SPEECH ASSISTANT**
1. The future is not all voice interfaces, but instead it should focus on working within device capabilities to boost user accessibility and flexibility. Some email bot can offer voice-to-text interfaces, voice-to-voice
interfaces or text-to-voice interfaces, all depending on customer need or brand decision. 
2. A term used to describe the place where e-mail messages are received in an e-mail client or online e-mail account. The Inbox is the default location for all incoming mail, unless
3. If the email is open, go to the More menu and choose Add star. Or, select the star outline on the right side of the top of the message (next to the date and time).
**Libraries of Python**
1. Graphical user interfaces
2. Web frameworks
3. Multimedia
4. Databases
5. Networking
6. Test frameworks
**Input Design**
1. First of all, “smtplib” library needs to be imported.
2. After that, to create a session, we will be using its instance SMTP to encapsulate an SMTP connection.
   s = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
   NOTE: In this, you need to pass the first parameter of the server location and the second parameter of the port to use. For Gmail, we use port number 587.
3. For security reasons, now put the SMTP connection in the TLS mode.
   TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts all the SMTP commands. After that, for security and authentication, you need to pass your Gmail account credentials in the login instance.The compiler will show an
   authentication error if you enter invalid email id or password.
4. Store the message you need to send in a variable say, message. Using the sendmail() instance, send your message. sendmail() uses three parameters: sender_email_id, receiver_email_id and message_to_be_sent. The
   parameters need to be in the same sequence.
   This will send the email from your account. After you have completed your task, terminate the SMTP session by using quit().
**Applications of Artificial Intelligence**
1. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in
   the operating room, Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars.
2. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must
   account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that revents a collision
3. Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which
   help a bank's fraud department.
4. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.
**WHITEBOX TESTING:**
1. If we go by the definition, “White box testing” (also known as clear, glass box or structural testing) is a testing technique which evaluates the code and the internal structure of a program.
2. White box testing involves looking at the structure of the code. When you know the internal structure of a product, tests can be conducted to ensure that the internal operations performed according to the
   specification. And all internal components have been adequately exercised.
**Steps to Perform WBT**
Step #1 – Understand the functionality of an application through its source code. Which means that a tester must be well versed with the programming language and the other tools as well techniques used to develop
the software.
Step #2– Create the tests and execute them.
When we discuss the concept of testing, “coverage” is considered to be the most important factor.
Here I will explain how to have maximum coverage from the context of White box testing.
